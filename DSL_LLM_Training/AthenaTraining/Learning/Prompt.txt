I’m going to train you on learning the Athena DSL. For this, I will provide the following information in 3 phases:
    -Phase 1: I will show you the formal definition of the DSL.
    -Phase 2: I will show you related articles about its creation, explanation, constraints, and characteristics.
    -Phase 3: I will show you examples of Athena mapped to SQL, MongoDB Validator, and Cassandra.

While I’m showing you the phases, I don’t want you to say anything — simply memorize what I provide. Afterwards, when you receive the information 
in each prompt, I want you to respond with “Received.” When I write “End of training”, then I want you to display:
    - Comments or feedback about your learning (explain in detail how your experience was and what you think about the DSL).
    - Questions or suggestions (state questions that are ambiguous or could be clarified for better understanding).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Prompt]
Phase 1: The file with the formal declaration is attached.

[Instruction]
You must pass him: [File: 1-Step (Formal Definition)/Formal Specification.txt]

[Prompt]
Phase 2: The files with articles related to the DSL are attached.

[Instruction]
You must pass him: [Folder: 2-Step (Articles) -> Athena.png, ChapterAthena.pdf, DesignAthena.pdf]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Prompt]
Phase 3: Five examples are provided along with their corresponding mappings to relational schemas, Cassandra, and mongodb.create with validator.

[Instruction. Note: You need to copy and paste the content manually because the file format is not supported for the LLM to process directly]
You must pass him: [Folder: CentroDeportivo -> CentroDeportivo.athena, CentroDeportivo.cql, CentroDeportivo.js, CentroDeportivo.sql]
You must pass him: [Folder: SoftwareDev -> SoftwareDev.athena, SoftwareDev.cql, SoftwareDev.js, SoftwareDev.sql]
You must pass him: [Folder: SoftwareProject -> SoftwareProject.athena, SoftwareProject.cql,SoftwareProject.js, SoftwareProject.sql]
You must pass him: [Folder: Umugram -> Umugram.athena, Umugram.cql, Umugram.js, Umugram.sql]
You must pass him: [Folder: Vigilancias -> Vigilancias.athena, Vigilancias.cql, Vigilancias.js, Vigilancias.sql]

End of training.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(from this point on, any questions the LLM might have regarding the training should be resolved)
