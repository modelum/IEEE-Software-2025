When customers register in the store, they sign up as users and provide personal data, email, username, password, 
and payment details (VISA, MasterCard, PayPal, or others). When a new user signs up, they can indicate that another user referred them. 
When the new user makes a purchase, the referring user receives a 5% discount voucher for a purchase. A user can be premium to obtain 
benefits such as free shipping. There is a product catalog. Each product is recorded with its name, price, description, image, manufacturer, 
stock, and other attributes that depend on the product. Products are grouped into categories (Laptops, Printers, Drives, Monitors, etc.). 
Each product has a list of related products. Users can share their opinion about the store and rate it from 1 to 5. A purchase made by a user 
is recorded as a sale with one or more sale lines, and for each line the product and the number of units are recorded. For each sale, the 
total amount and the date and time of the purchase must be recorded. Discounts can be applied to a sale and can be defined at any time. 
A sale will record the discount if one has been applied. Discounts are recorded as a name with the prefix “DESC” and a description. More than 
one discount can be applied to a purchase—for example, a DESC-BlackFriday plus a DESC-Referral. Delivery and potential product returns may be 
out of scope for our migration. I suggest some queries: Q1. Products by one or more filters: type, size, price, … Q2. Purchases by a user within 
a date range Q3. Products purchased by a user within a date range Q4. List of the 10 best-selling products in each country Q5. Users whose direct 
or indirect referrals have submitted a negative rating Q6. List of products purchased by a user and by all of their direct or indirect referrals.
