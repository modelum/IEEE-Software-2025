Next: I will additionally provide you with an Athena schema. I want you to create an Orion file based on schema modification code from the following languages:
    1. Code in SQL
    2. Code in CQL
    3. Code in Cypher
    4. Code in MongoDB
I only want you to provide a clear, clarified answer to what is requested, showing the result in a clear format.

[Prompt]
1. Convert an SQL schema to Orion.

[Instruction. Note: You need to copy and paste the content manually because the file format is not compatible for the LLM to process directly]
You must pass him: [File: Schema2Orion/Umugram.athena]
You must pass him: [File: Schema2Orion/SQL2Orion.sql]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Prompt]
2. Convert an CQL schema to Orion.

[Instruction. Note: You need to copy and paste the content manually because the file format is not compatible for the LLM to process directly]
You must pass him: [File: Schema2Orion/Umugram.athena]
You must pass him: [File: Schema2Orion/CQL2Orion.cql]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Prompt]
3. Convert an Cypher schema to Orion.

[Instruction. Note: You need to copy and paste the content manually because the file format is not compatible for the LLM to process directly]
You must pass him: [File: Schema2Orion/Umugram.athena]
You must pass him: [File: Schema2Orion/Neo4j2Orion.cypher]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Prompt]
4. Convert an MongoDB schema to Orion.

[Instruction. Note: You need to copy and paste the content manually because the file format is not compatible for the LLM to process directly]
You must pass him: [File: Schema2Orion/Umugram.athena]
You must pass him: [File: Schema2Orion/MongoDB2Orion.js]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Prompt]
Now comes the reverse test. The following message contains an Orion schema and you must translate it into the SQL, Neo4j, Cassandra, and MongoDB schemas.
You should only translate the operations supported by those schemas; for the ones that cannot be translated, you will write "Operation not supported.". Remember 
that the operations supported by each schema are described in the Orion chapter we provided during training, along with a reference image.

[Instruction]
You must pass him: [File: Orion2Schema/EduPlatformChange.orion]

Congratulations, you have successfully learned the Orion DSL.
Use your memory function to remember it and to be able to use it in other chats.
